# **Python Learning Journey: Welcome Programs**

## **Purpose**
This repository contains Python code samples showcasing each of the following data types:

---

## **Contents**
A syllabus-like breakdown of all included programs:

1) int: Integer values.
2) float: Floating-point numbers.
3) complex: Complex numbers with real and imaginary parts.
4) str: Strings, representing text.
5) list: Ordered and mutable collection of elements.
6) dict: Dictionary, representing key-value pairs.
7) set: Unordered collection of unique elements.
8) tuple: Ordered and immutable collection of elements.
9) None: Represents the absence of a value.

The goal is to provide beginners with a clear understanding of these types and their basic characteristics.

### **Overview of Python Data Types**
- **int (Integer)**:
Represents whole numbers, positive or negative, with no fractional part.
Example values: -1, 0, 42.

- **float (Floating-Point)**:
Represents real numbers with a decimal point.
Example values: 3.14, -0.001, 2.0.

- **complex (Complex Numbers)**: Represents numbers with real and imaginary parts..
Example value: 3 + 4j, where 3 is the real part and 4j is the imaginary part.

- **str (String)**: Represents a sequence of characters, enclosed in quotes.
Example values: 'hello', "Python".

- **list (List)**: Represents an ordered, mutable collection of elements.
Example values: [1, 2, 3], ['a', 'b', 'c'].

- **dict (Dictionary)**: Represents a collection of key-value pairs.
Example values: { 'name': 'Alice', 'age': 25 }.

- **set (Set)**: Represents an unordered collection of unique elements.
Example values: {1, 2, 3}, { 'apple', 'banana' }.

- **tuple (Tuple)**: Represents an ordered, immutable collection of elements.
Example values: (1, 2, 3), ( 'x', 'y', 'z' ).

- **None (NoneType)**: Represents the absence of a value or a null value.
Example value: None.
